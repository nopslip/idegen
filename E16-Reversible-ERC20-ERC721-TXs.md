#### Intro
Welcome to I, Degen - A podcast about crypto technology, security, and culture. With a healthy balance of enthusiasm and skepticism, we dig into a weekly look at crypto, cutting through the misinformation and hype in search of signal in the noise.

#### Episode Summary

This week we discuss the draft of the US House's Stablecoin bill. CFTC's 250k fine for BzX & the Ooki DAO. We talk about the 0xBAD MEV bot getting owned, and we dig into the recent paper on reversible ERC20 and ERC721 transactions. 

# I, Degen - Weekly
1. 9/20/2022 - From CryptoBreifing - [US House proposes stablecoin bill that would put a two-year ban on algorithmic stable coins](https://cryptobriefing.com/could-the-new-house-stablecoin-bill-kill-frax-and-dai/)
    
* U.S. lawmakers are reportedly drafting a bill to place a two-year ban on certain stablecoins.
* The House Stablecoin Bill would target "endogenously collateralized stablecoins."
* The bill would allow both banks and non-banks to issue stablecoins. However, bank issuers would need approval from federal regulators such as the OCC. As for non-bank issuers, the legislation directs the Federal Reserve to establish a process for making application decisions.
* The House Stablecoin Bill would make it illegal to issue or create new stablecoins that mimic the functionality and features of TerraUSD

NOTE: This is an early draft, not final so take it for what it is.

The documents were simultaneously submitted through a help chat box on the DAO's website.
